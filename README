Keeloq encryption algorithm.  Might be useful if you are playing around with Microchip Keeloq chips.  I verified that this algorithm gives the same results as that produced by the Microchip SDK for several test cases.  The Keeloq algorithm is not patented.  However, since Microchip does hold a patent on its application to secure keyless entry, it probably would not be wise to make a commercial secure keyless entry product using this algorithm in a non-Microchip processor.  Personal experimentation should be okay.  If you decide to make something commercial, buy Microchip's processors.
